# Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

An interactive dashboard for analyzing social media sentiment. Users can upload text files and visualize positive, negative, and neutral sentiment trends.
## 📊 Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

> **Recruiter-ready AI/ML portfolio project** demonstrating applied NLP, model deployment, and data visualization using real-world unstructured text data.

### 🔍 Project Overview

The **Sentiment Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive web application that analyzes and visualizes the emotional tone of text data (positive, negative, or neutral). It is designed to help users quickly understand public opinion, customer feedback, or social media sentiment through clear metrics and visual insights. The dashboard combines natural language processing (NLP) with data visualization to support data-driven decision-making.

### ❗ Problem Statement

Organizations and individuals often deal with large volumes of unstructured text data such as reviews, comments, or survey responses. Manually analyzing this data to understand sentiment is time-consuming, inconsistent, and error-prone. There is a need for an automated, accurate, and easy-to-use tool that can:

* Classify text sentiment reliably
* Provide confidence scores for predictions
* Present results in a clear, visual, and interpretable format

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Framework:** Streamlit (interactive web dashboard)
* **Machine Learning / NLP:**

  * Scikit-learn (traditional ML pipeline)
  * Hugging Face Transformers (pre-trained sentiment model)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly
* **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* **Environment:** Virtualenv / requirements.txt

---

### 🧠 Model Architecture & Evaluation

* Utilized a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to classify text into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** categories.
* Applied text preprocessing including normalization and tokenization.
* Generated **confidence scores** for each prediction to improve interpretability and trust.
* Evaluated model outputs using sampled predictions and manual validation to identify limitations and edge cases.
* Documented common challenges such as sarcasm, mixed sentiment, and domain-specific language.

### ⚙️ How It Works (Steps)

1. **Data Input**

   * Users upload a CSV file or input text directly into the dashboard.

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Text is cleaned (lowercasing, removing special characters, tokenization).

3. **Sentiment Prediction**

   * The sentiment analysis model processes the text and assigns:

     * Sentiment label (Positive / Negative / Neutral)
     * Confidence score

4. **Results Aggregation**

   * Predictions are stored and aggregated for analysis.

5. **Visualization**

   * Sentiment distribution charts
   * Confidence score summaries
   * Tabular view of predictions

6. **Insights & Export**

   * Users can interpret trends and optionally export results for reporting.
